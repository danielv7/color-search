# meeting-search PROJECT

## Project setup - How to Run the Project

git clone https://github.com/danielv7/meeting-search.git
npm install
npm run serve
```
### Project Features I Implemented

- The feature I choose to implement was allowing the user to interact with the search results. I gave the user the option to either delete a search result or pin/un-pin a result. If a user pinned a result it would automatically move the pinned result to the top of the list and if un-pined it would move down accordingly. I also added basic formatting features to format dates, emails, and phone numbers in a more user-friendly way.
